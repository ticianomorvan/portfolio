        This was the first event I attended, as well as the first event
        alongside CrESI. We participated as an Impact Startup of their ALPHA
        Startup Programme. I talked with a lot of people from all over the world
        but specially brazilians, who were very interested in our work and
        congratulated us for being pioneers in the LATAM market.

      <p class="text-gray-400">
        As days were passing and I was talking to more and more people, I
        discovered that we were trying to shine in a market with very few or no
        real competitors, because we work on a topic that is considered a
        "taboo". This, of course, made me very happy and motivated to keep
        working on better solutions and to make CrESI spread worldwide.
